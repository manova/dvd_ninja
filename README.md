## DVDNinja

A nodejs application that lets a user query dvd release information based on filter terms like genre, release date and rottentomatoes ratings. The result set also includes top torrent links and magnets as crawled from [Kickass Torrents](http://kickass.to/). The source code also includes python spiders that were used to crawl relevant data from rottentomatoes  and kickasstorrents.
